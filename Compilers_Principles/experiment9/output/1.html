        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            In this article, I shall discuss some of the fundamental topics in
            producing a structured document. This document itself does not go into
            much depth, but is instead the output of an example of how to implement
            structure. Its Latex source, when in used with my tutorial
            provides all the relevant information.

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This small document is designed to illustrate how easy it is to create a
            well structured document within Latex. You should quickly be able to
            see how the article looks very professional, despite the content being
            far from academic. Titles, section headings, justified text, text
            formatting etc., is all there, and you would be surprised when you see
            just how little markup was required to get this output.
        </p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Structure</h2>
        <p>
            One of the great advantages of latex is that all it needs to know is
            the structure of a document, and then it will take care of the layout
            and presentation itself. So, here we shall begin looking at how exactly
            you tell latex what it needs to know about your document.

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Top Matter</h2>
        <p>
            The first thing you normally have is a title of the document, as well as
            information about the author and date of publication. In latex terms,
            this is all generally referred to as top matter.
